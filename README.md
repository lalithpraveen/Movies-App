In this project let's built a **Movies App** by applying the concepts I have learned till now. 

I demonstrated my skills by creating an app that will fetch data from an internal server using a class component, displayed that data, using **component lifecycle** methods, **routing** concepts, **authentication**, and **authorization**, and added responsiveness to the website.
